# BubbleBuster
A browser multiplayer game. My first project.
This game is built all by me at very initial stage of my learning so responsiveness, performance and compatiblity is a bit issue with this.
But my main concern was to be quick and very creative, so there is high chances that you will like it. 
You are welcome to make it better if interested.
Some significant changes yet to be made.

After cloning,
